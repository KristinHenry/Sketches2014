Sketches2014
============

An artistic exercise: following prompts from an artistic group, I develop generative art sketches aproximately daily. Some sketches take me longer to complete. 

Since these are intended as purely creative, rough sketches, code quality may vary. My objective is to implement a visual idea, as quickly as I can.
