","body":"Sketches2014\r\n============\r\n\r\nAn artistic exercise: following prompts from an artistic group, I develop generative art sketches approximately daily. Some sketches take me longer to complete. The prompts are coming from a group of people who are actually sketching things (not with code), so some may seem a little odd.\r\n\r\nSince these are intended as purely creative, rough sketches, code quality may vary. My objective is to implement a visual idea, as quickly as I can.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
