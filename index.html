<p>An artistic exercise: following prompts from an artistic group, I develop generative art sketches approximately daily. Some sketches take me longer to complete. The prompts are coming from a group of people who are actually sketching things (not with code), so some may seem a little odd.</p>

<p>Since these are intended as purely creative, rough sketches, code quality may vary. My objective is to implement a visual idea, as quickly as I can.</p>
      
<p><b></b>What is a sketch?</b>  I see it as quick code...like sketching with pencil, but getting the code down to generate an image</p>

<h3>Prompt: "At least four rainbows"</h3>
<p>Once I got this prompt, the idea for doing all these sketches with code started forming. I did this with drawarc() from PIL</p>

<h3>Prompt: happy trees</h3>
<p>This one inspired me to try coding something up with python and Python Image Library</p>

<h3>Prompt: "A Robot who ordered pizza and it came with the wrong toppings on it."</h3>
<p>This was the first prompt, and I sketched it with a pencil on paper.</p>
