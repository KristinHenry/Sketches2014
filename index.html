<p>An artistic exercise: following prompts from an artistic group, I develop generative art sketches approximately daily. Some sketches take me longer to complete. The prompts are coming from a group of people who are actually sketching things (not with code), so some may seem a little odd.</p>

<p>Since these are intended as purely creative, rough sketches, code quality may vary. My objective is to implement a visual idea, as quickly as I can.</p>
      
<p>What is a sketch?  I see it as quick code...like sketching with pencil, but getting the code down to generate an image</p>
